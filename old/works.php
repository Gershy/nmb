								<h1>Summary</h1>
								<p>
									Twelve-year-old Lewis Castorman is a master locksmith: there is no lock on earth that he is unable to open. He is therefore flattered when world-renowned chemist Ernst K. Grumpel invites him to his office in New York City and offers him a lock-picking assignment. His confidence quickly turns to dismay, however, when he learns this job will take him to Yellow Swamp in northern Alberta, the scene of a disastrous chemical spill a year earlier. He is also horrified to discover that Grumpel is utterly ruthless and, through his chemical inventions, can alter the rules of nature at his will. But the assignment is one that Lewis can't refuse.
								</p>
								<p>
									How is Grumpel able to create such miraculous transformations? What secrets has he locked away and why has he taken pains to store them in Alberta? Despite the strange discoveries Lewis will make at every turn in his adventures, nothing will prepare him for the final encounter that awaits him in Yellow Swamp.

								<h1>Excerpt (Chapter 1)</h1>
								<p>
									Lewis Castorman was way behind schedule. His alarm clock had gone off at half past seven, but he had stayed in bed and waited for his father to wake him. It was only at 7:56 a.m. when the radio played an ad for the Fort Knox Locking System that his dark brown eyes opened in worry and he remembered that his father hadn't come home.
								</p>
								<p>
									Today was what? Lewis glanced at a calendar from Houdini Armour and Company and saw that it was Tuesday already. His dad should have been home the Friday before. Saturday would have been okay but Sunday was... preposterous! His father had been late before, like that time he had opened a swing bridge in Florida, but he had always telephoned to keep Lewis informed. So why this silence for five long days?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Lewis!"
								</p>
								<p>
									At the sound of Mrs. Gibson's voice Lewis ran for his clothes.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Hurry up! We overslept and you'll be late for school!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"I'll be down in a minute Mrs. Gibson," Lewis called, stuffing a leather case into his pocket after checking to see that all its picks were inside.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Always have your tools on hand," his father continually told him.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Because you never know when a door will lock behind you."
								</p>
								<p>
									His equipment in place, Lewis entered the bathroom, where he washed his face and combed his chestnut hair. He stared at his reflection.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Dad's okay," he whispered to himself. "It's not like... you know what. He'll be home in time for supper."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I've prepared some oatmeal," Mrs. Gibson announced when Lewis was seated at the kitchen table. "I had to make it quickly because I slept through my alarm."
								</p>
								<p>
									"It smells delicious," Lewis said, wondering why there was onion peel in it.
								</p>
								<p>
									"And be sure to drink up," Mrs. Gibson added, handing him a glass of juice that smelled like cheese.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Thanks," Lewis said, containing a groan. Mrs. Gibson had been with them for almost a year, but he still wasn't used to her cooking habits – the way she mixed weird ingredients together, then expressed surprise when he didn't want to eat.
								</p>
								<p>
									And her cooking was just the tip of the iceberg. He had seen her every day for the past twelve months, but her appearance still struck him as unusual. Not only was she large – six foot six and four hundred pounds – but her head was wide and football-shaped, and beneath a mask of talcum powder her skin was green. Her hair was orange, thick as cord, and looked a lot like an old floor mop. She also wore a pair of rubber gloves and a metal ring around her neck – for good luck, she explained. Finally, her voice was lower than her father's, and he had seen her eat six apple pies in one sitting.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Good morning, everyone," Mr. Todrey announced, emerging from the back room and sitting at the table. "Aren't you two running behind schedule?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Mrs. Gibson sniffed. "I got up late. Although it's hardly your concern."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Is there any oatmeal left?" he asked, scanning the front page of the Mason Springs Gazette, "New York State's finest morning paper." "It smells delicious."
								</p>
								<p>
									"There is, but I'm eating it. I'm Lewis' housekeeper, not your personal cook."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Look at that," Mr. Todrey said. "Grumpel's closing branches in Maine and Quebec. He's shut eight factories over the past three months."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Don't mention his name!" the housekeeper cried.
								</p>
								<p>
									"But it's odd," he mused. "Everyone's nuts about his chemicals, so why are his companies shrinking in number? If anything, he should be opening new factories."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I said don't mention his name in this kitchen!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"All right. Calm down. There's an article here about Yellow Swamp. I'll read it in silence if you serve me some oatmeal..."
								</p>
								<p>
									Mr. Todrey might have been Mrs. Gibson's twin. Not only was he exact same size, but his skin betrayed an identical shade of green under a lavish coating of Grumpel's Facial Ointment. His orange mustache was just like her hair, and he wore rubber gloves and a ring around his neck. Needless to say, this was more than a coincidence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Unlike Mrs. Gibson, however, Mr. Todrey liked chemistry textbooks. When he wasn't reading the paper, or filching snacks from the kitchen, he was wrapping his head around molecular acids, ionized suspensions, and nucleonic squeezes.
								</p>
								<p>
									But he was nervous, Mr. Todrey was. He was always peering out the window and asking Lewis about the people he had seen. If Lewis mentioned he had talked to a stranger, or that his class had been taught by a substitute teacher, Mr. Todrey would gasp and question him closely. Who were these people? Had they asked where Lewis lived? Had they mentioned anyone named Gibiwink or Todrus?
								</p>
								<p>
									Lewis sometimes suspected Mr. Todrey had broken some law, but his father always laughed at this suggestion and said they were lucky to have such interesting tenants.
								</p>
								<p>
									His father. Lewis's fears flooded back with a vengeance. Why wasn't he home? Why hadn't he phoned? Had he met with trouble? Had there been an accident? To stop himself from panicking, Lewis left the table. "I'm off," he declared.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You haven't eaten anything," Mrs. Gibson wailed.
								</p>
								<p>
									"I'll be late," Lewis called, moving toward the door.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What about your homework?" Mr. Todrey asked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"My composition!" Lewis cried. "Thanks. I almost forgot."
								</p>
								<p>
									He approached a staircase that led to the basement. At the head of these stairs stood a squat wooden column whose top had been fitted with a strip of glass. The glass was blue and was tilted at a sixty degree angle. Holding his hand to the glass, Lewis smiled as a sensor scanned his handprint and caused a bolt on the downstairs door to open, at which stage several lights in the stairwell flickered on. He descended the steps two at a time. By the time he reached the bottom, the basement door had opened and the well-lit space beyond was visible. As he crossed the threshold, he felt his worries lift.
								</p>
								<p>
									From outside, the house appeared ordinary. Modest in size and a little rough around the edges, with its peeling paint and weed-choked lawn, it wasn't anything special to look at. And the interior was the same, with its worn furniture, books, and simple knick-knacks. Normal people whose idea of an exciting time was to watch the late-night movie on television – that was what these furnishings said.
								</p>
								<p>
									The basement suggested a very different picture. It was cluttered with materials to the point of bursting. There were tools of every size, shape, and colour: drills, table saws, lathes and metal presses. Blocks of steel were piled in one corner, and beside them was a selection of cogs of every conceivable size and design. And then there were the interesting gadgets – infrared sensors, high-grade lasers, and coils tipped with miniature cameras, ones you could steer inside the larger locking mechanisms.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lewis approached a table that ran the length of the basement and thought about the hours he had spent in this room. From an early age his parents had brought him into this space and patiently taught him every trick of the trade, every known way to construct a lock and get it open.
								</p>
								<p>
									Locks. They were scattered across the table. Some were very run-of-the-mill – the padlock, combination lock, surface auxiliary and pin tumbler cylinders. Then there were the others: the titanium "gridiron" for high-security prisons, the convex "strangulator" for an F-18 fighter plane, the phantom hyperlink that was said to be unbreakable...
								</p>
								<p>
									Unbreakable. Lewis recalled an exchange between his parents a month before the disaster had struck and two days after his eleventh birthday. "There's no such thing as unbreakable," his father had joked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"I disagree," his mother had said. "One day I'll build a lock that even you can't open."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Like the Blackhawk 33?" his father had teased.
								</p>
								<p>
									"The modulator was faulty! And the clamping system almost had you fooled!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"But I did pick it in the end."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I'm telling you, I'll build an unbreakable lock. You'll see!"
								</p>
								<p>
									He closed his eyes. It would never happen. He remembered waiting for his mother to show. For days on end he had sat by the phone, hanging on her call. Then his father had walked into the kitchen one night – that was the very same day their tenants had moved in – and with a look of devastation had told him the bad news.
								</p>
								<p>
									His father. Where was he? Why hadn't he phoned? Was history repeating itself?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Stop it!" he whispered. "Get a grip on yourself!"
								</p>
								<p>
									His composition was lying at the end of the table. He picked it up, crammed it in his knapsack, and turned toward the basement exit. As he climbed the stairs, the heavy door locked behind him and sensors dimmed the lights one by one.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What about your lunch?" Mrs. Gibson asked as he emerged on the ground floor and hurried to the door.
								</p>
								<p>
									"No time!" Lewis cried, scrambling outside. "I'll see you later!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"But it's your favourite!" Mrs. Gibson yelled, holding up a bologna sandwich with mould on its crusts.
								</p>
								<p>
									Quick as a flash, Mr. Todrey gulped the sandwich down. "No point letting it go to waste," he said, beaming.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lewis heard the housekeeper scream from halfway down the block.

								<h1>Review</h1>
								<p>
									Need a lock picked? Call the Castormans! Don't be fooled by Lewis Castorman's age: he may be only 12, but, bested only by his parents, he's one of the best locksmiths in the world. The Castorman family can unlock the unlockable, and create unlockable locks. It's hard to imagine creating such a lock, but for Ernst K. Grumple, a famous chemist and the most powerful man in New York City, a permanent lock is a necessity. Mrs. Castorman was recruited/forced by Grumple to manufacture such a lock. Once the lock was in place, Grumple went against his word and, rather than releasing her, caused Mrs. Castorman to mysteriously disappear. Lewis was positive Grumple was responsible, but who in their right mind would believe Lewis over Grumple? No one who valued their life, that's who! Lewis always suspected Grumple: he had a knack for making his problems disappear. No one was brave enough to turn on Grumple, with his powerful chemical and fleet of giant, muscular salamander bodyguards, even when the coincidences become too much. Lewis tries to ignore the obvious, and his father, Mrs. Gibson, Mr. Todery, and Lewis' good friends, Alphonse and Adelaide Pangettis, do the best they can to help Lewis get over his loss.
								</p>
								<p>
									With Mrs. Castorman gone, Mr. Castorman hired two of the oddest characters Lewis had ever met, Mrs. Gibson and Mr. Todrey, to help raise Lewis. Sometimes Lewis questions his father's brilliance every time he tries to choke down Mrs. Gibson's interesting meals. Lewis tried to be polite, but Mrs. Gibson's food never made it easy (almost anyone would have a difficult time eating oatmeal with olives)! If Mrs. Gibson and Mr. Todrey, who are strange in appearance as well as behaviour, were not so kind to Lewis, he would surely have believed his father had lost his marbles!
								</p>
								<p>
									The day his father vanished, Lewis started to question his own sanity: the disappearance of his mother long ago, and his father's recent disappearance, the two best locksmiths in the world, couldn't possibly be coincidence. It isn't long before Lewis' worst fears are confirmed, and Grumple comes for him, too. With a lock designed to remain locked forever, and his father's life at risk if Lewis fails or refuses to try, there is no option for Lewis but to help Grumple, no matter how much Lewis hates the man.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lewis feels terrible when Mrs. Gibson, Mr. Todrey, and the Pangettis get pulled into Lewis' adventure. Alphonse Pangettis is excited to be going on an adventure that would make the stories in his favorite comic book, Bombardier 19, pale in comparison; his sister Adelaide, however, is ready to clock Alphonse the next time he mentions that stupid comic book! Mrs. Gibson and Mr. Todrey are as devoted as ever to Lewis and would not consider staying behind even if Grumple were not forcing them to go to one of the ugliest and most dangerous places in Canada – Yellow Swamp, an area of Alberta Lewis' family used to visit in the summer before Grumple turned it from a beautiful natural space to a desolate and unwelcoming place.
								</p>
								<p>
									Somewhere in that swamp is a lock: Grumple does not know how to unlock it, or even where it can be found! He has complete faith in Lewis and his ability to undo his mother's work; Lewis' failure would lead to his father's death.
								</p>
								<p>
									Throughout the adventure, true identities (and species) are revealed, riddles unravelled, and bonds stronger than Grumple's secret strengthened. Never underestimate the power of three kids, two frogs, a giant bat, a flying dinosaur, and a stranger!
								</p>
								<p>
									Everyone knows what it's like to lose someone close; Lewis lost his mother when he was very young, and he still misses her many years later and is certain Grumple is responsible for his loss. His good friends, including two giant frogs in disguise, do everything they can to help Lewis deal with his loss and focus on what he has: his father and friends, and, following in his parent's footsteps, a great future as a locksmith. Readers will instantly fall in love with the characters, including a giant bat Lewis saves from a monstrous spider, and even 'the Stranger' who is covered in bark and has a strange smell. Readers will instantly sympathize with Lewis and feel his pain as he struggles to deal with the death of his mother and the task of unlocking the lock his mother created, the last thing she did before Grumple killed her.
								</p>
								<p>
									I sometimes have trouble with fantasy, and Locksmith's list of characters includes an alien that looks like a dinosaur with 12 wings and 30 legs, talking frogs, bodyguard salamanders, and chemicals that turn absolutely anything into pink goo food that is delicious, especially compared to some of the food Mrs. Gibson makes. Nonetheless, readers will find themselves quickly wrapped up in the storyline, leaving no time to consider the plausibility of the story. Maes makes sure the fate of each character is accounted for as the story concludes but leaves the reader hoping for a sequel. A highly recommended read for all ages!
								</p>
								<p>
									Highly Recommended.

								<h1>Summary</h1>
								<p>
									It is the year 2213. Fifteen-year-old Felix Taylor is the last person on Earth who can speak and read Latin. In a world where technology has defeated war, crime, poverty, and famine, and time travel exists as a distinct possibility, Felix's language skills and knowledge seem out of place and irrelevant.
								</p>
								<p>
									But are they?
								</p>
								<p>
									A mysterious plague has broken out. Scientists can't stop its advance, and humanity is suddenly poised on the brink of eradication. The only possible cure is Lupus Ridens, or Laughing Wolf, a flower once common in ancient Rome but extinct for more than 2,000 years.
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix must project back to Roman times circa 71 B.C. and retrieve the flower. But can he navigate through the dangers and challenges of the world of Spartacus, Pompey, and Cicero? And will he find the Laughing Wolf in time to save his family and everyone else from the Plague of Plagues?

								<h1>Excerpt (Chapter 1)</h1>
								<p>
									Marcus Licinius Crassus was standing in the street, surrounded by two hundred slaves who were holding buckets and awaiting his signal. Before him was an insula, a badly built apartment block of brick and timber, overcrowded, unhygienic, and easy to catch fire. That explained why its middle stories were ablaze and threatening to spread the flames everywhere.
								</p>
								<p>
									Next to Crassus was the building's owner. As tenants on the upper floors pleased to be rescued, and a crowd gathered to watch the drama, and pedestrians cursed because the street was blocked, he turned to Crassus and tugged at the great man's toga. "I'll sell it for a million denarii and not a sestertius less."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Ten thousand denarii."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Ten? Are you mad? Five minutes ago you offered me fifty thousand..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"And five minutes from now I'll offer you a mere three thousand."
								</p>
								<p>
									"This is robbery, Marcus Licinius. I'll not have anyone forcing my hand...!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Then I'll leave with my slaves and you can watch your building burn."
								</p>
								<p>
									"This is preposterous...!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Eight thousand denarii."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Eight? But you just offered me ten! What effrontery! No, wait! Eight it is! Douse the fire and she's yours for eight...!"
								</p>
								
								<p>
									At the blast of a whistle Felix started from his reverie. He steadied the book that was slipping off his lap – a leather-bound edition of Plutarch's Life of Crassus – and sat up in his g-pod. Why had the whistle sounded? And what it his imagination or were they hovering in mid-air? He glanced at an info board and saw that, sure enough, their velocity stood at zero MPH.
								</p>
								<p>
									He glanced at his reflection in a Teledata screen. A serious-looking face stared back, its eyes blue-green and brimming with confusion, the nose long and bony (exactly like his father's), the hair straw-coloured, and the chin sharp and dimpled. With a grunt of impatience he engaged the screen and murmured, "External monitor."
								</p>
								<p>
									Almost instantly he was looking at a view outside the shuttle. Below him was the coast of Greenland – it was covered in piping and switching stations but was otherwise uninhabitable. On impulse he said, "Pan three hundred and sixty degrees," and the scene changed abruptly, revealing pale blue sky, cumulus clouds and... Wait. Over there, at NNW 315 degrees, a Medevac was flying toward them, its blue flashers signaling a Code A health priority. What...?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Honoured passengers," a voice announced, "Inter-City Services regrets to inform you that Shuttle 997, from Rome to Toronto, is experiencing a medical crisis on board. A Medevac will be docking in fifty seconds and will convey the affected passenger to the nearest Health Facility. Service is expected to resume momentarily. All g-force pods have been hermetically sealed and will disengage on the completion of our disinfectant protocols. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience."
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix was bewildered. How could a Health Priority develop in mid-flight? Citizens were scanned for health anomalies at home, at every Portal and before any shuttle took flight, to prevent emergencies like this from occurring. Why hadn't this illness been caught in advance? And what did "disinfectant protocols" mean?
								</p>
								<p>
									He felt a vibration. On the screen the Medevac was beside the shuttle and extending an Evac-tube to its roof. A moment later, halfway down the aisle, a circular panel of the roof swivelled open and a Flexbot arm appeared inside the shuttle. Seizing apart six rows down from Felix, it maneuvered it to the ceiling egress and into the tube joining the crafts together. Felix spied the patient - an elderly man. His head was slumped and he was encrusted with blisters; they were red and covered every inch of his skin.
								</p>
								<p>
									Wishing he could help this man, Felix watched as the panel on the ceiling closed. Seconds later his g-pod trembled as the Medevac drew away from the craft.
								</p>
								<p>
									"This system is so old," a voice spoke over his pod's speaker. Glancing around, he spotted a teen his age who was seated across the aisle from him. He was tall, big-boned, and confident-looking. It features, two, were unnervingly calm, a result of the ERR (Emotion Range Reduction) he undergone. And his dark eyes were sparkling from his retinal upgrades.
								</p>
								<p>
									"My name is Stephen Gowan," he said. "Does it mean something to you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Then you obviously aren't a programmer. I placed first in the North American Advanced Algorithmic series and work now as a consultant in Rome. In any event, the software on the shuttle is M4. You know what that means?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"No."
								</p>
								<p>
									"It was installed in 2210 and hasn't been upgraded. Three whole years without a partial upgrade! That explains why the sensors didn't catch that man's illness - although it's on his home monitor didn't detected either."
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix was going to ask if he'd seen the man's blisters, but with a resonant hum the shuttle accelerated westward. Greenland was fading on the Teledata screen and the Medevac itself was just a blip in the distance. But... How strange. A blue haze was streaming from its rear exhaust, a sign that it had switched to its fusion thrusters. That happened when the craft was leaving the Earth's atmosphere and why would the medevac travel off-planet instead of delivering the patient to Stockholm or Oslo? Before Felix could work this puzzle out, Stephen Gowan spoke again.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What's that?" he asked, pointing to Felix's lap.
								</p>
								<p>
									"This?" Felix asked, holding up the Life of Crassus, "It's a book."
								</p>
								<p>
									"A real book? Like the ones you see in museums?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Hold it up so I can look at it more closely."
								</p>
								<p>
									"It was printed four hundred years ago," Felix explained, pressing the book against the pod's membrane.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What's that funny writing?" Stephen asked, wrinkling his nose in curiosity.
								</p>
								<p>
									"On the right you have classical Greek; on the left is a version in Latin."
								</p>
								<p>
									"What are Greek and Latin?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"They're languages that were spoken in ancient times."
								</p>
								<p>
									"You mean, before everyone learned Common Speak?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Before that, even. Plutarch wrote this work two thousand years ago."
								</p>
								<p>
									With a look of disbelief Stephen asked how he had come across the book. Felix explained that his father ran the world's last Book Repository and had filled their home with stacks of tomes. His father was also trained in Greek and Latin - there were only two such experts alive in the world - and had been teaching them to Felix for the last eleven years, from the day he turned four and been old enough to read. He'd also been studying these civilizations, hence his frequent trips to Rome.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Why not use a Portadoc? It's easier to carry and holds every text that's been written, including Blutarch's books."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Plutarch. My father won't allow me. He says a book in chances the pleasure of reading because the contents seem unique and important, whereas a Portadoc jumbles everything together."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Your dad sounds old-fashioned."
								</p>
								<p>
									"That's for sure. If he could, he'd stop all whether regulation, protein synthesis, retinal upgrades, synapse modification, ERR, genetic transference..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Has he ever had a real job?" Stevens smirked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Ten years ago he uncovered the Temple in France. It was hidden from sight for two thousand years until he discovered its existence through an old Roman text.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What's a temple?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"It's a building where people gathered and gave thanks to... they communicated with something they called gods."
								</p>
								<p>
									"The way we admire Reason on World Union day?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yes. Something like that."
								</p>
								<p>
									"That sounds exciting," he said, implying the exact opposite with his tone, "but I think we've arrived." As if to confirm his observation, a voice announced the shuttle had talked in Toronto's Central Depot and passengers should disembark at their leisure. There was no further mention of "disinfectant protocols."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Nice to meet you," Felix called to Stephen who, now that the seals on this potted open, was standing in the aisle and hurrying away, as if anxious to escape this talk of books and ancient temples. When he failed to answer, Felix shrugged and packed away his book.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was the same old story. As soon as people learned about his interest in the past, they assumed he was crazy and refused to talk to them further. His father suffered from the exact same problem - apart from his wife, he didn't have any friends - and was always warning Felix that their studies over the past would lead to ridicule and isolation.
								</p>
								<p>
									By now the shuttle was empty. With a sigh, Felix climbed to his feet, headed to an exit, and made his way into the station. As always, it was crowded with people from all over the globe, Buenos Aires, Nairobi, Jerusalem, Mecca. Moving toward a Dispersion Portal, he admired the totalium vault overhead, then let his glance drift to the lower Western Wall, part of which was built on the buildings earliest foundations that could be dated to what time when people traveled by train. His father, too, had once mentioned a door that led to something called the subway system, a network of tunnels served by underground transport. Felix had always wanted to explore this system, but the law clearly stated that this subterranean area was strictly off limits.
								</p>
								<p>
									He joined a line up at the Dispersion Portal. As passengers were catabolized in the doorframe's wave of current, he thought about the Life of Crassus and how he had to finish it before his father arrived home...
								</p>
								<p>
									Weight. What was that? A short distance off, a woman had stumbled - one moment she'd been walking; the next she had collapsed to the floor. Had she slipped...? No, she was lying in a motionless heap. As the crowd paused and wondered what to make of this scene – their ERR prevented them from reacting promptly - Felix started forward to offer his assistance. He'd taken just a couple of steps went two Service Units pulled up and stopped him in his tracks. Signaling that this was another Health Priority, they ordered people to keep away from the woman. What...?
								</p>
								<p>
									The crowd was backing off. The two units had formed a stretcher between them and lifted the woman onto its surface. As they floated soundlessly toward an exit, Felix glimpsed the woman's hands: the fingertips were crimson.
								</p>
								<p>
									The room returned to normal. With the Service Units gone, the travellers hastened to their docking ports. For his part, Felix retreated to the portal and, moments later, was poised at the head of the line.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Destination, please?" a voice asked politely, as the Portal's turquoise current swirled, like water on the verge of freezing over.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Area 2, Sector 4, Building 9," Felix answered.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Processing," the voice announced. Then a moment later, "Please advance."
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix stepped into the field. In the instant it took his Athens to be scrambled, dispatched across the city and reconfigured in the Portal outside his home, he just had time to register the thought that something was askew in their carefully ordered world.

								<h1>Review</h1>
								<p>
									There are few themes quite so overused and abused in speculative fiction as time travel. It's such a well-tilled field that few writers can produce a time-travel novel that doesn't induce eye-rolls or a sense of "been there, done that." University of Waterloo classics professor Nicholas Maes is apparently one of those rare few who can pull off the time-travel trick. His new novel for young readers, Laughing Wolf, is strikingly original, with a convincing command of both future world-building and historical recreation. The novel begins in 2213. Fifteen-year-old Felix Taylor, whose father runs the Earth's only book repository, lives in a world free of war, poverty, and crime, a world where people matter-of-factly undergo Emotion Range Reduction procedures to blunt the primal reactions that lead to conflict. As the novel opens, however, this seeming paradise is struck by a mysterious plague that threatens to destroy the human race. It is discovered that this epidemic is related to a historical plague that was cured by Laughing Wolf, a flower that flourished in ancient Rome. The flower, however, has been extinct for hundreds of years.
								</p>
								<p>
									As the last healthy person on Earth capable of reading and speaking Latin, Felix is sent back to 71 BC to recover samples of the flower in the hopes of saving humanity. In his quest, he encounters historical personnages including Pompey and Cicero and meets with Spartacus on the night before his final stand against Rome. He also finds himself – repeatedly – in mortal peril.
								</p>
								<p>
									Laughing Wolf is a page-turner rooted in careful history, vivid imaginings, and strongly formed characters. It raises many discussion-worthy questions on the nature of history and liberty, on emotion versus intellect, and on the role of the state and of the individual. It's an impressive work that, though intended for kids, can be enjoyed by readers of just about any age.

								<h1>Excerpt (Chapter 1)</h1>
								<p>
									Simon could hardly keep himself from yawning. He was waiting by the cash in Noah's Pet Shop for his brother Ian to return from the back. He was tired of apologizing as people brushed by, and of grinning at the cashier who thought he was there to shoplift. Without knowing it, he was staring at a case of vinyl dog bones, his hands in his pockets, a blank look on his face. After weeks of begging and pleading with his parents, Ian was finally getting a hamster. He was scouting out the choices for the fourth time that week, because he wanted to find a hamster without any flaws. Despite their many trips to the shop, the perfect hamster had eluded him so far.
								</p>
								<p>
									Simon fidgeted. He had tons of homework to do that evening. He'd been assigned a book report a month before and it was finally due that Friday. He hadn't even started reading the novel. There was a math test too, the very next day, and while math was one of his better subjects, his attention had been slackening these last few weeks. It was the same with biology: he had a project due on evolution and so far he hadn't lifted a finger. So why was he wasting time in that shop? His best bet was to track Ian down and drag him away, by force if necessary, even if he had to traipse to the back where music was blaring from a half-dozen speakers. He was preparing himself for the gruelling ordeal when he heard a familiar voice call out. "Well look who's here."
								</p>
								<p>
									Simon wheeled and practically groaned. Confronting him were Winston and Peter, the coolest kids in his grade eleven homeroom. Peter's dad was a hotshot lawyer, and Winston's owned half of Chinatown. Handsome, athletic, popular, and rich, the pair had more than their share of good luck. So why did hipsters like them love to pick on Simon? It was funny, in a sick sort of way. The moment they caught sight of him, they would drop everything (unless they were playing online poker) and follow him all over the place, like dogs in hot pursuit of a chicken.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You can't say hello?" Peter demanded. Even though he was born in Vancouver, he had a slight South African accent.
								</p>
								<p>
									"He's pretending he doesn't know us," Winston said, his smile mocking and faintly cruel. With his sleek frame and sinewy limbs, he resembled a fighter in a Kung Fu film. And he was extremely quick on his feet, maybe because he took Ritalin daily. "He's ashamed to be seen with us. We're not cool enough for a guy like him."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I was thinking about something."
								</p>
								<p>
									"About those dog bones, right?" Peter jeered with a malicious smile.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"You seem to be eyeing those bones real closely. I guess your dog has exacting tastes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I'm waiting for my brother."
								</p>
								<p>
									"A brother? Really? Is he from the shallow end of the gene pool too?" Peter was smirking. He was having fun.
								</p>
								<p>
									"If you say so."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Carpenter, there's no point riding you if you won't fight back." Like Peter, Winston was smiling widely. Simon practically groaned. These guys were getting started and wouldn't leave him alone - unless he managed to distract them somehow.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You'd better hurry. The snakes are getting ready to eat."
								</p>
								<p>
									"What do you mean?" Peter's smirk faded slightly.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You're here to watch the snakes, right? The staff is getting ready to feed them."
								</p>
								<p>
									"How do you know? The snakes are way at the back."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Because the mice are panicked," Simon said. "They sense what's coming and are squeaking in fear."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Are you saying you can hear them?" Winston asked scornfully.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You can't?" Simon was surprised. It amazed him how dull people's senses could be. The mice were so panicked that their squeaking was awful – and that was with the music blasting.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Of course we hear them," Peter lied. "And that means the show's about to begin. I guess we'll catch you later, eh? Come on, Win. Let's leave genius here to study his dog bones."
								</p>
								<p>
									As the pair moved off, Simon called to them, "If you see my brother, can you tell him I'm waiting?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"What am I? A messenger service? Go tell him yourself!" Peter yelled back.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Go to hell, Carpenter!" Winston added.
								</p>
								<p>
									They passed down an aisle. Winston announced, in a very loud voice, that Simon was the weirdest kid in school, "Grade A weird," he practically shouted, "One day we'll read he's some psycho killer."
								</p>
								<p>
									If their purpose was to worry Simon, they'd achieved their goal. He knew he was weird in everyone's eyes. His very family thought he was strange, his mom, dad, and even Ian. "The eccentric," they called him, in a friendly way. His parents would often throw him this look when they learned that he'd neglected to study or became distracted when driving the car. If he really was 'eccentric' as his family believed, then Winston was right and he was probably psycho.
								</p>
								<p>
									But there he was, worrying again. He'd promised himself he wouldn't dwell on this stuff and go back to acting like the kid he'd been four years ago. Until his thirteenth birthday he'd been normal enough and people like Winston would never...
								</p>
								<p>
									Winston. If that oaf came back and found him standing by the dog bones, he would make Simon's life hell, there and in school. Simon had to grab his brother and leave. Now, while the going was good. Why did he keep stalling?
								</p>
								<p>
									As if he didn't know.
								</p>
								<p>
									To begin with, the store's lighting was horrible. The fluorescent bulbs were like fire on his eyes and their drone-like hum was driving him crazy. The towering shelves were boxing him in, as were the pets in their stainless-steel cages - what person in his right mind would keep an animal trapped?
								</p>
								<p>
									But the worst part was the music. There were speakers hanging all over the place. Ahe further you went the more the music lunged at you. Simon loathed it more than he could say. The mix of high- and low-pitched notes felt like vicious pin pricks against his skull, and the faster they sounded the more the pain they inflicted, until his head was on the verge of exploding. And as soon as one song finished another would begin, and the agony would start all over again.
								</p>
								<p>
									"It depends on the music," his dad once said, when Simon had complained about a radio blaring. "Some music is awful, sure. Like that hop hip stuff..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Hip hop," Ian had corrected him.
								</p>
								<p>
									"But there's jazz, baroque, classical, and folk. There's something for everyone, that's what I'm saying."
								</p>
								<p>
									He was wrong. All music made Simon want to puke. Not metaphorically (as his dad would say), but actually puke. He wondered why people sought this torture out, carrying Ipods to fill their heads with poison. And why would stores pump this garbage out day and night, indifferent to the misery they caused? Music should be outlawed, he thought. Just like people couldn't carry guns, it should be illegal to play music in public.
								</p>
								<p>
									This wasn't helping any. He still had tons of homework to do and Ian was drooling over the hamsters. Enough was enough. Simon would use brute force and yank him away. Otherwise he'd stay until the staff kicked him out, admiring one ball of fur after the next. And, again, if Winston found him there...
								</p>
								<p>
									Simon gritted his teeth and rushed down an aisle. He hurried past the avian section, with finches, budgies, and a sad looking parrot; then came the aquaria, with its fish swimming blindly in circles, goldfish, angel fish, guppies, and loaches; then there were the puppies, the ferrets, cats, gerbils, mice and...
								</p>
								<p>
									He stopped.
								</p>
								<p>
									Behind the music – which like people being beaten to death - some poor soul was screaming. The voice was odd, not like any he'd heard. Its timbre was rough and the pitch was different, less controlled... not quite human. It sounded like a bird was peeping, a squirrel was maybe clearing its throat and air was leaving a balloon. For all its strangeness and frailty, however, there was no mistaking the rage it projected. It contained a furious, violent note.
								</p>
								<p>
									"... Who de hell d'you think you are, jailin' me like dis! Let me outta here! And turn dat crappy music off! If you don't let me out, I'll break out on my own. And when I'm free, you lura oafs, I'll cut your stinkin' throats...!"
								</p>
								<p>
									Simon's blood turned cold. The sound was coming from up ahead, near a stack of cages that contained all sorts of rabbits. Was someone trapped inside? No, how could that be? Who could fit inside a cage so small?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Did you hear me? I said I'll cut your throats!"
								</p>
								<p>
									Even as he trembled slightly, Simon did feel sorry for this stranger. He glanced up and down the shelves, desperate to help the poor guy out. Slowly a realization dawned: no one else noticed the shouting. The staff and customers weren't batting an eye, as if it were normal for someone to be shrieking like that.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hang on sec! What was that?
								</p>
								<p>
									To his right was a rectangular cage, three feet long and two feet wide. It had a clear plastic lid with metal mesh on top. Inside, beside a wooden hut, a Mini Rex rabbit twitched its nose. It was grey, white, and innocent looking. Its ears were downy and pink on the inside, it had a blood-red stain on its front paw, and its eyes were two pure ebony marbles. It looked like any common rabbit but... those shouts and curses? They were coming from it. Simon crouched, just to be sure. Yep. A rabbit, a rabbit, was muttering threats. He stared at it dumbstruck.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What the hell'r you lookin' at? You ain't seen a rabbit before, you fat, ugly lura?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"What? Wait. Are you talking to me?" The hair on Simon's neck was bristling.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! Hey! Dis is somethin'! Can you actually hear me? I mean, no joke, I'm getting' through to you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Is this some type of trick?" Simon glanced round nervously, thinking Winston was behind this 'talking' creature. He was good with tech stuff and had maybe hidden a device in the cage. That was it. Winston was talking into a nearby mike and capturing Simon's response on film. He would screen it in school and Simon would look like a fool.
								</p>
								<p>
									"It ain't no trick!" the voice continued. The rabbit had its paws against the lid, in what seemed to be a show of desperation. "But you ain't answered me! How come you can hear me? Who de hell are you?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"So you're not Winston?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Who de hell's Winston? Look, dis is amazin'. I don't know who you are, but I can tell one thing: you don't know who you are either, not if you're receivin' me. But never mind. Dat's okay. The point is, I need help. You gotta open dis cage and let me go. Better yet, take me home. I swear to youse on all dat's holy, you's help me out and I'll pay you back..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Simon!" Much to Simon's relief, Ian appeared. "I'm ready to go. I finally found the perfect hamster. The clerk, his name's Tim, said he'll put him aside. We can pick him up tomorrow, or the next day, even. What's wrong? Your face is really pale."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Nothing," Simon said, eyeing the rabbit still, "What do you make of this rabbit here? Does he seem normal?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"The rabbit? Yeah, he's normal enough. Although he's nothing like Magnus."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Magnus?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"My hamster. That salesman, Tim, said Magnus is special. You should see the way he ate some apple..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Hey!" the rabbit interrupted, "did you hear what I said? Help me and I'll pay you back."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Did you hear that?" Simon asked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What? The music? Or that parrot squawking?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yeah, the parrot," Simon said. He tried to smile but it looked like a grimace.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What's the matter?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Nothing. Look, we should go. We've been here half an hour already and I have a massive test tomorrow." He turned and led Ian away.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Hey! You's can't leave!" the rabbit screamed, "All I'm asking is you open dis cage...!.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Let's go!" Simon insisted, picking up his pace.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Come back! Help me! I'll kick your head in if you don't...!"
								</p>
								<p>
									Simon bolted toward the exit. With every step the rabbit's cursing grew fainter, until it vanished altogether as Simon passed into the late spring air. He was sweating heavily and his legs were shaking. Luckily, Ian was too happy to notice. He was talking about Magnus and how he was the world's smartest hamster. To shut him up, Simon offered to race. Ian liked racing, especially when Simon let him win.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You were probably dreaming," he told himself as he and Ian started running down the sidewalk.
								</p>
								<p>
									But it was no dream. Either that rabbit had spoken or, like Winston said, he was totally nuts.
								</p>

								<h1>Review</h1>
								<p>
									Whoa. What a ride! Nicholas Maes's Transmigration is brilliant: a well-conceived fantasy with a unique premise and a gripping storyline. The novel begins with a talking bunny, but there is nothing cute or cuddly about the sinister alternative world history that Maes creates so carefully. It should perhaps have been a clue that a West Coast bunny talks with a Brooklyn accent, but I admit I found it only a bit out of place—until the plot progressed. In Maes's history, a species of souls—bolkhs—coexists with humans as we have developed through the evolutionary process: a species that wants now to take back what was once theirs, destroying all human life. Young Simon Carpenter, of Vancouver, BC, is a tool they need for their war against humanity. When he learns this, his comfortable world is shaken to its foundations, and he must flee for his own safety and that of his family. The complicated relationships between players—different types of souls and their various connections with physical bodies—are adeptly explained to the reader through Simon's own learning experience. I almost needed to create a rubric, but Maes brings in the terms just often enough to help the reader learn his nomenclature and the associated characteristics of his world...

								<h1>Summary</h1>
								<p>
									Avi Greenbaum is Jewish and lives in West Jerusalem. Moussa Shakir is Palestinian and lives in East Jerusalem. Both are 15 years old, live without their fathers, adore their older brothers, and belong to the same soccer club. Avi commemorates the Holocaust and celebrates Israeli independence, while Moussa mourns on Nakba Day, marking the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes and land in 1948. Their lives are parallel lines: they have everything in common and nothing at all. Each is oblivious to the others existence.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									As Avi and Moussa go about their daily routines in the spring of 2006, they face reminders of the conflict that has dogged the region for the past three generations the security wall, suicide bombings, police operations, and the looming shadow of war. While navigating this legacy of suspicion and violence, they must decide what their own roles in the stalemate will be.

								<h1>Excerpt (Chapter 1)</h1>
								<p>
									The rain kept falling. Water was dripping against each surface in Jerusalem: the houses, the stores, the cafes and cinemas, the cars and buses, the city's famed monuments, layer upon layer of foundations and walls that, over thirty centuries, had witnessed miracles and bloodshed. Jews, Christians, Muslims, and atheists, the rain struck them all alike, indifferent to their disparate outlooks. This was the malkosh, the last storm of the spring. It was a pity rain was so infrequent: it was the one, sole blessing everyone could agree on.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the foot of one building dating back three generations, a cat was scavenging in a garbage bin. It could smell chicken bones and was frantic to retrieve them. Attacking a plastic bag with its claws, it was oblivious to the rain, the odd passing car, and, at the end of the street, the city's old district: Suleiman's walls stood a short distance off. Absorbed with the prospect of a lavish feast, the cat didn't care that it was straddling two realms, one Jewish, one Arab, each apprehensive of the other. Politics meant nothing when food was at stake.
								</p>
								<p>
									Almost there, the smell of grease was tantalizing. A few more strokes and...
								</p>
								<p>
									The cat froze. Something had fallen and landed near its whiskers. It was small, cylindrical and... Ouch! It burned. The cat eyed the smouldering object until it fizzled in the rain. Wrinkling its nose, it returned to the food.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You're smoking another?" Avi Greenbaum asked, his brown eyes opened wide in surprise. He and his brother were on a porch above the street. Their mother was visible inside their apartment, clearing away the cake she'd baked to celebrate Avi's fifteenth birthday. The TV was on; it was almost time for the news.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Leave me alone," Dan grumbled, lighting up a cigarette, "I hear enough from Ima about my smoking." He inhaled, held the smoke in his lungs, and blew it out contentedly. "Every soldier in my unit smokes a pack each day. The captain goes through two packs. Our colonel's worse and smokes non-stop; I'd say he's up to four packs now. And the general must smoke six, which means the prime minister must go through cartons. I sure would hate to see the state of his lungs."
								</p>
								<p>
									He smiled as he took a drag, his lean frame huddled against the chilly air. Avi nodded. His brother always smoked when he'd had a rough day. Dan was attached to a military unit that policed the barrier in the Jerusalem region, and he'd seen more than his fair share of trouble. And because he'd been promoted to lieutenant last month, his decisions affected the people around him, himself, his buddies, and the wider population - Arabs and Jews. Studying his brothers sharply drawn features, Avi thought he was entitled to smoke.
								</p>
								<p>
									"So what do you think?" Dan asked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Of Dror?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Who else?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"He seems okay. He's arrogant, like most kibbutzniks, but very smart. I also like that he's into jazz: it says a lot of his favour. I still can't believe Rachel's getting married. And you? What do think?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"He's seems decent. I'm surprised she fell for a techno geek. I saw her marrying the poet type, you know, someone who works for Tnuva cheese and writes poems about children praying as tanks roar by... His floating eye would drive me crazy."
								</p>
								<p>
									"It makes him look shifty," Avi agreed, "like a zombie in a bad horror movie."
								</p>
								<p>
									His brother laughed and Avi almost glowed. Dan was older by only five years, but he often acted a lot like a father; since their dad's return to Toronto four years back, Dan had tried to fill his role. Because he'd picked up Hebrew quickly and adapted to Israeli ways at school, he'd helped their mom with the stuff their dad should have seen to: the mortgage, insurance, and other such details. Rachel was the oldest but they relied on Dan.
								</p>
								<p>
									His father. That reminded him.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Abba hasn't phoned. Do you think he forgot?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"That it's your birthday? Nah. He always remembers. He'll phone soon, I guarantee."
								</p>
								<p>
									"It's too bad he couldn't come for Pesach."
								</p>
								<p>
									"His work keeps him busy. It wasn't his fault."
								</p>
								<p>
									Dan said this firmly. He hated even the slightest hint that their father had been wrong to go back to Toronto. The way he saw it, their dad had wanted to stay but hadn't been able to earn a good living. By returning to Canada and his job as a lawyer, he could pay the family's expenses and keep them on in Israel. So he was self-sacrificing, not a failure or quitter. Avi had his own take on his dad's decision, but it wasn't one he could share with Dan, unless he wanted a yelling match.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Ima was crying when she served the cake," he said, steering the talk to safer ground, "Sometimes she's too sentimental."
								</p>
								<p>
									"You're turning fifteen," Dan said. "Your childhood has ended."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I thought that happens at thirteen for us Jews."
								</p>
								<p>
									"You know what I mean. You're filling out. In another three years you'll be entering Tzahal. Your teachers will treat you differently now, they'll show you new stuff and get you ready for the army. You'll even learn how to handle a gun."
								</p>
								<p>
									Avi nodded. It made him faintly nauseous to think that soon he too would be part of the army. And Dan was right: the 'grooming' had started. Their phys ed teacher had been yelling all year that they had to be in top condition; in geography they were learning to use a map and compass. And teachers were discussing their army service, in low, serious tones, the way one would engage men, not adolescents.
								</p>
								<p>
									He had to keep his hands from shaking.
								</p>
								<p>
									"I love this rain," Dan said, flicking a butt into the air, "but we should return before Dror thinks we're avoiding his eye."
								</p>
								<p>
									Placing his arm around his brother, Dan steered him inside. Although the apartment was small and cold in winter and the plumbing was faulty, it was a cozy space overall. The living-room's furniture was comfortable, and there were shelves with books on all kinds of subjects. The walls were covered with gorgeous landscapes that Avi's mother Shosh had painted. Many depicted winter scenes: Shosh was convinced they would cool things down in summer, if only psychologically. The TV stood against one wall; Rachel and Shosh were watching the news, along with Rachel's fiancé Dror.
								</p>
								<p>
									"There was an incident by the wall," Dror spoke. A muscular guy, he was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt stamped with the smiling image of Bob Marley. He was warm and friendly and spoke with self-assurance, as if he knew better than everyone else – a typical Israeli. "They say a couple of shots were fired."
								</p>
								<p>
									"There was an incident," Dan spoke tartly. He didn't like discussing the day's events, in case the wrong emotions were provoked. "It happened at the Kalandiyah checkpoint. There was a family with a very sick child – he had leukemia and needed a blood transfusion. They had to get to a hospital fast but lacked the right permit and begged the guard to let them pass."
								</p>
								<p>
									"So what happened?" Rachel asked. With her chestnut hair and bony features, she looked the spitting image of Dan. "I'll bet the guard didn't lift a finger."
								</p>
								<p>
									"He had his orders," Dan replied, "And you have to remember the line-ups are huge. Everyone's on edge, the guards and civilians."
								</p>
								<p>
									"How did it end?" Shosh was eyeing Dan. His stories always drew her in, since they gave her an insight into events that would otherwise pass unseen.
								</p>
								<p>
									"The father got so angry that he threw a punch. He was quickly subdued but other Arabs moved in and three warning shots were fired. I arrived five minutes later. We summoned an ambulance and let the boy through. As soon as he was gone, the crowd calmed down. The father's being detained, but he should get off with a warning."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Those checkpoints are monstrous," Rachel cried. "Those concrete towers are soul-destroying, not to mention the turnstiles and walls of steel. We treat the Arabs no better than cattle."
								</p>
								<p>
									"What about that bomb last week?" Shosh interjected, "It killed nine people in Tel Aviv and injured dozens more. Without the wall I couldn't sleep at night. I know it's not perfect but I'm glad it's there."
								</p>
								<p>
									"That's why we're pushing a million Arabs around? So that you can sleep soundly at night...?"
								</p>
								<p>
									The debate raged on. Although the women appealed to Dan and Dror, the men kept their distance. It was always like this: while the males might argue among themselves, they seldom spoke their minds when women were present. Avi suspected they knew things that the women weren't exposed to: facts and hard-won information that would pull the plug on any such discussion.
								</p>
								<p>
									And as always, he had nothing to say. He'd heard them argue so many times before that there wasn't anything new to add. And their talk made him very uneasy, especially because he'd turned fifteen. Something was over, something precious was gone. It had been slipping for the last three years but, as Dan himself had hinted, it had disappeared completely that day. The age fifteen seemed to make all the difference. The old Avi Greenbaum, who built forts out of pillows, who played with Lego for hours on end, who constructed model planes and watched hours of cartoons, this Avi Greenbaum was a thing of the past.
								</p>
								<p>
									What would replace him?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Enough politics," Dror finally broke in. "Let's discuss something else, like where we'll live after we get married. Rachel wants to stay here, but I would like to live in Tel Aviv."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Why would you want to live in Tel Aviv?" Shosh asked. "It's full of crazy drivers."
								</p>
								<p>
									"As opposed to Jerusalem where people are nuts with religion," Dan observed.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Exactly," Dror agreed. "I would like to live somewhere normal for once."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Then you'll have to leave the country," Dan joked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"We're not moving from Jerusalem," Rachel insisted, "I want to be able to walk to the Kotel."
								</p>
								<p>
									"But you never go to the Kotel!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"That doesn't matter. It makes me feel safe to know it's nearby."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I know what you mean," Shosh said approvingly, "It makes me feel secure as well..."
								</p>
								<p>
									These comments led a new discussion, about the value of sticking to the old traditions even if you weren't that religious. Avi had heard these arguments too and found them just as tedious. Why couldn't they discuss something positive, like music? Thank God the telephone intruded just then. And he guessed who it was before he picked up the receiver. His dad had remembered, as Dan had promised he would.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Happy birthday, Avi."
								</p>
								<p>
									"So you did remember!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Have I ever forgotten? My keys I forget, or my secretary's name, but birthdays, never. What's it like to be fifteen?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"It's the same as being fourteen but I get to stay up later." If only it were as simple as that. "I'm sorry you're not here. And we missed you at Pesach."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Things didn't work out. It's too bad too because the weather has been awful.
								</p>
								<p>
									It's snowing here, even as I speak. We had a blizzard last week and it's storming again. Why people ever settled here is way beyond me."
								</p>
								<p>
									As he went on to say he would be there for the wedding, Avi pictured him in his downtown condo, with snow burying the city alive and the traffic on Yonge Street brought to a standstill. Every tree would be coated in white, the city's sounds would be beautifully muted and everything would move in slow motion. He realized with a pang that he missed the winter. Far from being inconvenient, the snow was padding against the... crap out there. And his father knew as much. As sorry as he was to live far away, Avi could hear his relief when he complained.
								</p>
								<p>
									Why was he relieved? For the same reason Avi regretted that he'd turned fifteen.
								</p>
								<p>
									"... Are you going to that music festival in England?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"As far as I know," Avi said, returning to the conversation. "We were told to have a valid passport ready. That means it's still on."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Great. And have you opened your present?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"I have. Thanks a million. The Artie Shaw music book was just what I wanted."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Use it well. Your mom emailed me that you'll be playing soccer against an Arab team. Is that true?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yeah. Our first match starts in a couple of days."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I ask because I ran into a friend last week. Do you remember Phil Matthews? He's a freelance reporter?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"I don't think so."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Well, he's looking for a story with a Jewish-Arab angle. I mentioned something about your match and he'd like to interview a player from each team. Interested?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"I guess."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Great. I'll tell him. Now pass me to your mother. And remember: you'll see me in just under four weeks."
								</p>
								<p>
									Bidding him goodbye, Avi handed the phone over. For a moment he felt an emptiness engulf him. It was the thought of his dad living far away, and his brother's fatigue, and the news on TV, and the fact another year had passed and soon, very soon, he would have to do what all men do. He closed his eyes. The feeling wouldn't pass. To stabilize himself, he sat next to Dan who, sensing his mood, passed some pistachios over.
								</p>
								<p>
									"How's Abba?" he asked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"The same. It's snowing in Toronto."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I'd love to see it snow," Dan said.
								</p>
								<p>
									The siblings began discussing the stuff they missed most in Canada. Between them they mentioned diners, hockey, thunderstorms, forests, lakes, and summer camping. Rachel mentioned the trips they'd taken, and Dan agreed he missed them most, jumping in the car and heading down a highway, to PEI, BC or south of the border, on and on, seemingly forever.
								</p>
								<p>
									Dror inquired about PEI, and Dan and Rachel clued him in. Still reeling from his empty feeling, Avi grabbed some nuts and passed outside.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was beautiful out. The rain was like a whisper in his ear. Water was streaming in drops from a drainpipe and the tempo reminded him of Artie Shaw's "Temptation". Glancing into the street below, he spied a cat clawing about in a dumpster. Thinking it might like a pistachio nut, he cracked one open and tossed it down. It only made the creature jump and, with a growl of suspicion, it ran into the shadows, leaving its cache of chicken behind.
								</p>
								<p>
									Avi smiled and caught a raindrop on his tongue. He hoped the rain would never let up. <span class="star-break"></span>
									It was 2:00 a.m. when he finally stretched out. His shelves were empty and the walls were bare. His model planes and Lego set had been packed into boxes and stuffed away. He hadn't touched these things in ages but, until that evening, had wanted them around. He still wanted them close at hand but... enough was enough. They had to go. If they weren't staring him in the face each day, it would probably be easier to do what men do.
								</p>
								<p>
									When he turned the light off in his room, he felt he was saying good-bye to an old trusted friend.
								</p>

								<h1>Review</h1>
								<p>
									The latest novel from Toronto author and professor Nicholas Maes is a story of good and evil played out in shades of grey, offering readers something weightier than the average young adult fare.
								</p>
								<p>
									The theme of battle – be it personal, patriotic, religious, or athletic – permeates the tale. In Jerusalem in the summer of 2006, tensions between the Israeli army and Arab forces are boiling over. In the midst of this turmoil, a pair of 15-year-old boys are entangled in their own personal struggles. Avi Greenbaum is Jewish, Moussa Shakir Muslim. Both are preparing for manhood and have family members risking their lives in combat. Inwardly, though, both question their own fortitude when it comes to joining the fight themselves. When Avi's soccer team faces Moussa's in a series of matches throughout the volatile summer, more than team pride is at stake.
								</p>
								<p>
									The subject matter explored in Crescent Star is a far cry from Maes's previous YA offering, the fantasy-tinged Laughing Wolf, and it possesses a grit and realism that intrigues from the start. The novel moves forward with the precision of the soldiers depicted within its pages, and there is much headline-derived fighting and bloodshed.
								</p>
								<p>
									Maes juxtaposes his characters' points of view and allows them to act as guides for younger readers who may not be familiar with the history of the conflict. It becomes clear very quickly that not every war is black and white, and that sometimes solutions are as difficult to grasp as clouds of smoke.
								</p>
								<p>
									Crescent Star paints a vivid portrait of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and does so in a fair and sympathetic way. At the same time, both Avi and Moussa are depicted as typical questioning teens, unsure if the path their parents have laid out is right for them. The only difference is, instead of fighting their parents for more personal freedom at home, they're preparing to wage war in the streets.

								<h1>Summary</h1>
								<p>
									It's been a year since Felix Taylor travelled back to ancient Rome and saved his world from a lethal plague. Again his knowledge of Latin seems useless now that life in the 23rd century has returned to normal. But is it really? A stranger has discovered the time machine and used it to project back into the past. It becomes clear his purpose is to reverse Felix's success, to bring back the plague and doom future generations to death. To make matters worse, this stranger is very close to Felix. With help from his friend Carolyn, Felix must return to the world of Julius Caesar, as well as a later era divided by religion, to stop the re-emergence of the plague. If he fails to do so, his world will turn to dust like ancient Rome.

								<h1>Excerpt (Chapter 1)</h1>
								<p>
									Caesar brought his charger to a stop. The pair was standing in the middle of the river. As the current eddied about the horse's fetlocks, the general studied the terrain beyond. It was mostly open farmland and easily travelled. Enemy forces could be seen from a distance and its farms would be rich in provisions. All in all, this land was perfect... apart from the fact that it was strictly off limits.
								</p>
								<p>
									The air was still. If Caesar closed his eyes, it would be easy to imagine he was alone in that landscape, so quiet were the soldiers of the thirteenth legion, even though they were marshalled directly behind him. There was no talk, no coughing, no groans of fatigue, never mind he'd pushed them mercilessly. They were gazing at the river, excited and abashed at their appointed task.
								</p>
								<p>
									The river. It was maximum three ulnae in breadth, a cubit deep and its current was tame. It was nothing like the foreign rivers: the Arar, Rhodanus, Rhenus, Sequana and, strangest of all, the winding Tamesis, its banks lined with Celts when he'd last sailed its waters. Such rivers could have swallowed his legion, unlike this Rubicon which was just a feeble stream. And yet. On its northern bank he was a general of Rome; on its south he was nothing...
								</p>
								<p>
									"So? What's it to be?" a voice addressed him. Caesar smiled. His right-hand man Marcus Antonius had joined him.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Ave Marce. It's a funny thing. On this bank I'm in Cisalpine Gaul. I'm its leader and can act as I please. Across this trickle lies Italy. On its soil my imperium dies. If I lead my troops across, I'll no longer be Rome's champion but her back-stabbing son."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Don't tell me Caesar is getting cold feet? The victor of the Belgae, Suebi and Helvetii has met a boundary that gives him pause?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"You know how matters stand. If I cross my army over, I'll start a civil war. The Senate will pronounce me a hostis – me, Julius Caesar, a loyal Roman! There will be no peace until I've crushed their troops, or they've crushed mine. Blood will be shed, good Roman blood, and the land will teem with widows and orphans."
								</p>
								<p>
									"So you won't cross? These troops have marched behind you in vain? The legions that did your bidding in Gaul and wish to see you honoured - you would spurn their dedication? You would have them disband and go home to their families?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"The decision is too great for one man alone, even such a man as I."
								</p>
								<p>
									Caesar considered the river. A mist was rising from its surface. The land on its far side was calling to him. The sun, too, was glaring down, either admiring Caesar's brashness or appalled by it. Retreat or attack, which would he choose? The issue lay beyond all human judgement and he needed... help. He reached for the pouch that dangled from his cingulum.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Are you consulting your mistress?" Antonius joked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"She's never failed me yet," Caesar said. He was holding four astragali or knucklebones. Shaking them in his right hand, he muttered a prayer and rolled them onto his open palm. He studied the effects and smiled grimly.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What did you throw?" Antonius asked. His bantering was gone and he was serious now. Caesar held the bones out. "Mehercule! You've thrown a Venus!" Antonius cried, "Surely Fortuna must favour this venture."
								</p>
								<p>
									"So it would seem," Caesar agreed, prodding his horse forward. "Signal the men. We'll cross the river and gamble on war. The knucklebones have spoken. Alea jacta est!" <span class="star-break"></span>
									A whistle startled Felix from his reading. His book, Suetonius's Lives of the Caesars, slipped from his fingers to the floor of his g-pod. He sat up straight and looked around. The passengers in the shuttle were sitting calmly and gave no sign of having heard the signal. He consulted a Teledata screen to see where they were. The craft was over Iceland and fifteen minutes from the depot in Toronto. So why the whistle?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Honoured passengers," a voice broke in, "InterCity Services is pleased to inform you that Global President Siegfried Angstrom will be addressing the world in precisely five minutes. Please stay tuned for this important broadcast."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I was expecting this," Stephen Gowan yawned. He was seated beside Felix and had engaged the speaker. How typical. Whenever he was on the same transport as Felix, he'd sit beside him and jabber away.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What were you expecting?" Felix asked, retrieving his book.
								</p>
								<p>
									"It's been a year," Stephen drawled, "since that problem started. I can't remember what the problem was, but the president must be speaking to mark the occasion."
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix smiled ruefully. It was hard to believe that a year ago today a deadly plague had stormed the planet. Even harder to believe was his discovery of a text that had shown this plague had struck in Roman times and its cure back then had been the lupus ridens. Because the flower was extinct in 2213, he'd travelled back to ancient Rome, using the secret Time Projection Module (or TPM). Carolyn Manes had gone with him and together they'd tracked the lupus ridens down, brought it to the future, and stopped the plague in its tracks.
								</p>
								<p>
									As incredible as this 'mission' seemed, it was even crazier that people had forgotten the disaster. Once rescued from the jaws of destruction, the victims had shrugged and resumed their routines, as if their lives had never hung in the balance. Over the last twelve months, since the plague had been contained, not once had anyone referred to it in public, as if it had been a hiccup and nothing more. How could people forget so quickly?
								</p>
								<p>
									How? That was obvious. Enhanced ERR. And Mem-rase.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Honoured passengers," the voice spoke again, "InterCity Services is pleased to inform you that our Global President Siegfried Angstrom will be addressing the world in precisely three minutes. Please stay tuned for this important broadcast."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yeah right," Stephen smirked. "It will be as important as that book you're reading. What're you wasting your time on now?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Suetonius' Lives of the Caesars."
								</p>
								<p>
									"As in Caesar salad?" Stephen joked.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Caesar as in Julius. I found the book in Holland. It was left out in the garbage."
								</p>
								<p>
									"That's where it belongs!" Stephen sneered, "You really are something. You could study genetics, programming, or syn-chem; instead you read these fairy tales! If you're not careful, you'll end up being useless."
								</p>
								<p>
									As if to underline this point, the lights in the cabin flickered for an instant. This had happened a lot in recent days, and people just ignored it.
								</p>
								<p>
									For his part, Felix shrugged. Whenever Stephen talked to him, the guy would go nuts about his interest in Latin. Felix always wanted to say it was his knowledge of Latin that had saved the world, not Stephen's precious computer skills. But like most folks, Stephen didn't remember the crisis and Felix couldn't disclose his exploits. When General Manes had shown him the TPM, Felix had been forced to swear that he wouldn't breathe a word about it, on pain of life imprisonment off-world. And when he'd flown to it in recent days, to spend time with Carolyn, the general had reminded him to keep his mouth shut.
								</p>
								<p>
									But it was odd. For all the good his Latin had done, he was inclined to agree with Stephen Gowan.
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the last six months his dad's health had been off. His condition wasn't serious but he couldn't manage the Repository on his own - as Felix had often asked explained to Stephen, the Repository was the last collection of books on earth. This meant Felix had to help his dad out. Instead of studying math or syn-chem, as Stephen suggested, he spent his days roaming the planet and amassing books that needed saving. And when he wasn't hopping all over the place, he was cataloguing items and making repairs. The work was tedious, but necessary; otherwise the authorities would shut them down. And if the Repository closed, its books would perish.
								</p>
								<p>
									But he often wondered: was this his future? He would rescue books and keep them safe for people who had no interest in them? He would master languages that were no longer spoken and study subjects that had long been forgotten? The Repository was a graveyard of ideas. Was this where he wanted to pass his days...?
								</p>
								<p>
									"I spoke to Carolyn," Stephen spoke, "She said you're meeting later."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Yeah. We're playing Halo Ball."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Tell her to dress nicely tonight. And that my parents hate it when guests show up late."
								</p>
								<p>
									"She's meeting your parents?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"All of us are attending the awards ceremony."
								</p>
								<p>
									"What awards ceremony?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Geez, you're out of it, aren't you? I won a contest. Carolyn came in second. Boy, she hated losing."
								</p>
								<p>
									Again the lights wavered briefly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix was too distracted to question this flickering. Six months ago he and Carolyn had been flying to Warsaw to rescue yet another cache of books. They'd been debating the novel ERR limits when Stephen had told them to keep it down. Felix had introduced Carolyn to Stephen and she'd taken a shine to the geek. Since then, the pair had seen a lot of each other...
								</p>
								<p>
									"Honoured passengers," a voice broke in, "InterCity Services is pleased to inform you that our Global President Siegfried Angstrom will be addressing the world in precisely ten seconds. Please stay tuned for this important broadcast."
								</p>
								<p>
									"And she should adjust her skin tone," Stephen added. "She's way too pale."
								</p>
								<p>
									Before Felix could answer, a face appeared on every screen in the transport: Siegfried Angstrom. As always he looked terrific, with his leonine nose, stark blonde hair and glacier-blue eyes – his retinal implants augmented their brightness. Felix was thrown back a year, to the night he'd called the Angstrom Show and revealed the lupus ridens might be a cure for the plague. Angstrom had ignored him with withering contempt.
								</p>
								<p>
									He was even more forbidding now. Felix thought of Sajit Gupta, the former president. Unlike Angstrom, who was ice in human form, Gupta had been warm and friendly. That's why Angstrom had thrust him aside.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once the world recovered from the plague, it had reviewed Gupta's stewardship and found it wanting. People thought that he'd shown too much feeling; there was a rumour, too, that he'd had his Emotional Range Reduction (ERR) removed. Disgusted with his feely-mealy ways, the population had forced him to resign. Elections had followed and Angstrom had won.
								</p>
								<p>
									Because he'd run on an anti-feeling platform, his first act was to broaden the ERR range. The effects were obvious. When Felix talked with strangers, he might have been addressing a pile of rocks. It had been months since he'd heard anyone weep, scream or laugh. And because he refused to endure the treatment himself, people thought that he was the freak, when he smiled, frowned or spoke with feeling.
								</p>
								<p>
									While ERR was bad, Mem-rase was worse. This too was Angstrom's doing. Convinced the past had nothing to teach them, he'd broadened the old Mem-rase program, permitting citizens to delete their memories of the plague. This was why people couldn't recall the disaster.
								</p>
								<p>
									And there was more. Because Angstrom had no attachment to the past, his officials found the Repository to be a waste of funds. Over the last few months, e-briefs had arrived, to the effect that the Repository was being 'reconsidered', a fancy way of saying it would be closed in future. In fact...
								</p>
								<p>
									"Greetings," Angstrom spoke, interrupting his thoughts, "let me get straight to the point. It has been one year since we faced that 'disruption' and, after hesitating greatly, I decided to mark the occasion. Why my hesitation, you'll ask? Because by mentioning the 'disruption', I might seem to be admitting that we erred somehow, that luck saved us more than anything else, and that we must change the way we confront the world, from our science-bound perspective to something more emotional. But this is not my intention at all."
								</p>
								<p>
									Angstrom bristled here, as if daring viewers to challenge this statement. Felix thought the former talk host was glaring straight at him.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Let me emphasize right now that we did everything right. It was our cold hard reasoning that saw us through, and if we owe a debt to anyone, it's to our engineers and scientists. Luck didn't achieve our success, just as our 'feelings' had nothing to do with it, either. In fact, if we erred in any way, it was by relying too much on 'feelings' and 'luck', as if these had more to deliver than science and logic. If the 'disruption' taught us anything, it's that we need more science and less of everything else."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Did you hear that?" Stephen barked. "Science saves us, not your stupid books."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Shortly after the disruption," Angstrom continued, "I was voted in as president and decided that, yes, some changes would be productive. But far from rejecting our reasoned outlook, I was determined to embrace it even more than before. That's why my first act was to broaden ERR and to place an even greater brake on our emotions. I also urged citizens to enrol in the new Mem-rase program and thereby reduce our ties to the past. Have my initiatives borne fruit? I'll leave that to the people to decide, but it is worth pointing out global efficiency rates have never been higher."
								</p>
								<p>
									When he said the word 'efficiency', the lights wavered off and on.
								</p>
								<p>
									"He's so cool," Stephen crooned, oblivious to the lights, "One day I hope to be like him."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I wish to leave you with two thoughts," Angstrom concluded, "First, the hallmark of our lives is utility, not humour, art, beauty, or sentiment. We humans are at our best when we're useful, not effusive. More to the point, we belong to the future. There's no utility in looking to the past, only embarrassment that, for so long, we depended on luck and emotion to save us. That's why I urge you, having honoured the scientists who steered us to safety, to jettison this 'disruption' to the junk heap that is history. The past is over. Let's delete it from our hard-drives. By focusing on the future alone, we'll ensure good order and logic prevail."
								</p>
								<p>
									Angstrom glared at them one final time and his face quickly melted. It was replaced by a map showing the shuttle's position. They were flying over Labrador.
								</p>
								<p>
									"What a guy," Stephen crowed. "I'm glad I had my memories erased, the ones involving that stupid 'disruption'."
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix was distressed by the speech. Aware he couldn't speak his mind, he was about to make some lukewarm comment when a full-blown power outage cut him short. One moment every system was working; the next every screen fell blank, the lights died completely and the engine was silent. Their steady flight slowed and... the craft started falling.
								</p>
								<p>
									Within seconds they'd built up a terrific speed. The craft was nosing downward and Felix's knees were at his ears. There was a crushing sensation on his chest and face. His head was pounding. He was dripping sweat. He'd never been so scared before; at the back of his throat a scream started forming...
								</p>
								<p>
									As abruptly as it had failed, the power returned. The engine was humming, the lights flicked on and the craft swiftly straightened itself. Every screen was back online and a voice was explaining that the ship was fine and InterCity Services regretted the outage.
								</p>
								<p>
									Felix tried to calm himself. He took deep breaths and pressed his hands together, even as he looked the cabin over. His heart almost stopped. Everyone was calm. They'd been faced with death mere seconds before, yet they were serene, bored, utterly unfazed. As if nothing untoward had happened, Stephen was saying that Carolyn should dress in blue that evening.

									The fear Felix had experienced when the craft had failed? It was nothing like his terror just then, faced as he was with a crowd of human robots.

								<h1>Review</h1>
								<p>
									Published in 2009, Laughing Wolf introduces readers to a future society, set in the year 2213. Fifteen-year-old Felix Taylor is the last person on earth who can read and speak Latin. Technology has eliminated war, crime, poverty and famine, but has also obliterated the need for books, and the study of history. When a mysterious plague breaks out that has scientists baffled, humanity is on the brink of extinction. The cure, discovered by Felix in one of his "useless" history books, is a flower found in ancient Rome extinct for more than 200 years. Now Felix must travel back to Roman times and retrieve the flower before it's too late. It will take all of his knowledge of history and languages to navigate through the dangerous world of Spartacus, Pompey, and Cicero if he's to succeed in his mission.
								</p>
								<p>
									In Fortuna, publishing this August, One year has passed since the Plague was cured, and the world has for the most part, forgotten about their close encounter with death. Technology exists to suppress emotions and wipe memory, creating a dangerously detached society. Just when it seems life has pretty much gotten back to normal, the world is under threat once again. Someone has discovered the time machine, and used it to project back into the past, and attempt to reverse Felix's success in curing the plague. To make matters worse, that someone is a person who is close to Felix. With the help of his friend Carolyn, Felix must travel to the time of Julius Caesar, and a later era divided by religion to stop the reemergence of the plague before the world turns to dust.

									Spanish Philosopher George Santayana famously wrote in his 1905 work The Life of Reason"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them.", and this is the central theme of Canadian author and high school history teacher Nicholas Maes' Felix Taylor Adventures.
								</p>
								<p>
									Imagine if one day we simply decided the past didn't matter, and history was no longer studied or remembered. Not a big deal right? After all, history never repeats itself right? We'll never make the same mistake twice, right? We know that not to be the case, but that is what the majority of the people in Felix's society- including the President- believe. Reading and the study of history and languages is antiquated- unlike technology, which surrounds him. Luckily for Felix, (and the world) his father has insisted on a different sort of education. An education where he is surrounded by books, speaks Latin, and studies ancient history.
								</p>
								<p>
									Luckily for the reader, Maes' teaching background has enabled him to bring history to life in these novels, in a way that will keep easily-bored middle-schoolers engaged and turning the pages. Ancient history was violent and bloody, and Maes successfully captures these details in his writing. These details, combined with a survivial-of-the-world depends on you kind of quest make for a thrilling read. What Maes also does extremely well is to challenge his readers to consider the roles that history and religion play in our lives, and to understand how vital emotion and memory actually is.
								</p>
								<p>
									Whether you're a history buff or a sci-fi fan, these novels are entertaining and thought-provoking, and well-worth offering to tween readers. (Rachel Siegel, Rachel's Reading Timbits)

								<h1>Summary</h1>
								<p>
									Seventy-year-old Nathan Gelder has suffered a stroke. He is floating in a pool of tragic memories, half conscious of his family's visits and the ministering staff in a Toronto hospital. Past and present assail him unrelentingly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Born a half-Jew in Holland, and scarred by the loss of his parents to the Holocaust, Nathan has been forever at sea. His serene, middle class existence in Toronto, as a fastidious translator and family man, has neither prepared him for the exigencies of the late 20th century, nor helped him overcome his profound sense of loss. Confusion has led to obsession, and obsession has led to a cleansing act of retribution.
								</p>
								<p>
									As he lies suspended in his memories, his family catches wind of his crime. Is it possible this family man pushed mega-rock star Leonard Barvis to his death?
								</p>
								<p>
									The media descend. Even as their cameras besiege his paralysed body, and the rock star's fans stage riots world-wide, he pleads for vindication. Unfortunately he is on his own.
								</p>
								<p>
									Written in an elegant prose, with an equal mix of cantankerousness and mordant wit, Dead Man's Float is sweeping in its emotional impact. The result is a poignant, riveting juxtaposition of western history's darkest chapter and late twentieth century popular culture. Dead Man's Float will leave its readers gasping for air.

								<h1>Excerpt (Chapter 1)</h1>
								<p>
									Is this how it ends?
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm in my bedroom, or was a moment ago. My dressing gown is around my ankles and my underwear is halfway on. The walls are melting like ice cubes on the stove, as is the bureau with the Meissen figures. The window is shimmering: the elm outside and the street with its houses appear to be resting at the bottom of a river. And, Gottverdomme! My legs, my arms, my head, my... my boundaries!
								</p>
								<p>
									They're water, water, everything is water! I can't... I have no... everywhere, yes everywhere...!
								</p>
								<p>
									My mother, dressed in yellow, swings me in circles... My father, Dad, he's reading in his armchair... My uncle's request that I hear his last confession, the pang of thirst when I found out they'd been killed, my meeting with Pete inside the Hotel Manhattan, the derelict my wife almost crushed with our Buick, Netti’s cry of exultation, his suicide by gas dear God, and floating at the center, gloating at the center, his face, his, when he met his rock 'n roll maker...
								</p>
								<p>
									Memories. I'm floating in my memories, each so fresh and impossibly lucid that I could be experiencing them for the very first time, as if nothing has withered since their initial occurrence, not a tear, not an eyelash, not a smile, not a whisper.
								</p>
								<p>
									But if my memories surround me, if these memories contain me, is there anything left of me outside this pool? Is there anything solid outside this pool, his suicide by gas dear God, the derelict my wife almost crushed with our Buick? Is anyone standing guard outside this pool...?
								</p>
								<p>
									This is how it ends. <span class="star-break"></span>
									"Nathan! Nathan!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Mr. Gelder, if you can hear my voice, please speak or blink or squeeze my fingers. Any type of signal will do."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Nathan! Blink your eyes! Let us know if you can hear us!"
								</p>
								<p>
									"Dad! It's Jacob! You're in an emergency room. I'm here with Mom and..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Pete... I mean Jacob... you're in the doctor's way..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"That's okay Mrs. Gelder. Keep talking to your husband. For sure he's confused and only you can reassure him."
								</p>
								<p>
									What's happening? Where are all these voices coming from? I hear my wife and Pete and three strangers... Ah, the outside scene is jumping into focus, like a picture in the paint-by-numbers kit, and yes there's a small crowd gathered around me, with my wife and son frowning at its centre. But that still doesn't explain why they sound so nervous, why they’re bustling around and... Wait. Did someone mention an emergency room?
								</p>
								<p>
									"Please remain calm. And breathe deeply if you can sir."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Are you in pain Nathan?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"His blood pressure’s low. Let's go in through his leg."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I found a vein. Can I have that IV unit?"
								</p>
								<p>
									My God, she looks a mess, poor Sue. Her eyes are red, her lips are trembling, and her handkerchief’s half soaked with tears - concrete proof we are 90% water. And Pete - things are bad if he's expressing emotion, as he prides himself on his self-control, to the point his expression is almost always impassive, as if to prove he's a bona fide member of the tribe and accepts God's judgment and... That isn't fair. He's been working hard to bridge our disagreements, so why should I poke fun at him because he converted? Hey Pete! Pete! I didn't mean... It's no use. The sound travels in only one direction: I can hear their voices but can't signal my thoughts.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Where did you find him?"
								</p>
								<p>
									On the floor in our bedroom. He'd been getting dressed - his underpants were only halfway on. At first I thought he was clowning around, his sense of humour can be strange at times, but then I saw his coffee on the floor and I realized, I mean..."
								</p>
								<p>
									"I understand."
								</p>
								<p>
									He must've been lying there hours and hours. I thought it strange he didn't answer when I called at noon because he's always working at that time of day - he translates books and has his office in our basement - and he should've answered, I should've known."
								</p>
								<p>
									"These attacks usually take us by surprise."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Do you think, and I know it's too early to tell, but in your opinion, could he possibly get better?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"It's been known to happen. We’ll know more after we run a few tests. In fact, might I ask you to take a seat in the hallway? If you're interested there's a coffee stand outside the nurses’ station."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Nathan, did you hear? We’re going into the hallway but just for a moment."
								</p>
								<p>
									There they go. Pete has his arm around Sue, but awkwardly. They’re estranged. I should be there to intervene... although on second thought I'm glad I'm not, not if it means abandoning this pool. That's the one small trick I've learned about exile: the more readily you accept your new surroundings, the better for everyone, your loved ones included.
								</p>
								<p>
									What now? A black nurse is staring into my pupils. Look at those eyes, so bloodshot and bleary, so full of understanding and hard-won wisdom. For sure she's witnessed her share of disasters.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Nathan, honey, do you know what's happened?"
								</p>
								<p>
									I've never been so close to a Negro. Her skin... It's inscribed with such genuine sorrow that it’s causing these waters to ripple and swell.
								</p>
								<p>
									"You've had a stroke dear. It's affected both sides. It's serious, I won't lie to you honey, but you're doing a fine job. Keep it up, God bless you."
								</p>
								<p>
									A stroke? I should have guessed as much. My doctor warned me this might happen, and my hearts been sliding since my duel with Leonard, whose plunge to earth I reenacted this morning when my limbs liquefied in this pool took shape...
								</p>
								<p>
									"Did Matthews tell you? About the crash on Steeles?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"How bad?"
								</p>
								<p>
									"A dozen cases. North York can't handle them."
								</p>
								<p>
									"The lazy assholes."
								</p>
								<p>
									"The wagons should be here in a couple of minutes. It looks like we’re in for one hell of an evening."
								</p>
								<p>
									"Did you hear, Mr. Gelder? You've got company coming."
								</p>
								<p>
									Does anyone know I’m floating in a pool? In the neurology textbooks the doctors consult, is it mentioned that memories can be turned to water? It would comfort Sue greatly if she knew my situation, and Pete might suppress that constipated look.
								</p>
								<p>
									The scene is blurring over and everyone's faded, like a message on the beach that the tide rushes over. Am I getting sleepy? Can I sleep inside the school? And if I do fall asleep, what'll greet me when I wake up, assuming my faculties don't feel altogether?
								</p>
								<p>
									I don't want to know.

								<h1>Review</h1>
								<p>
									The post-Holocaust novel or memoir has been with us for 60 years now, and like many serious cultural artifacts, it shapeshifts with the times. Dead Man’s Float, by Nicholas Maes, joins this sombre parade and manages to turn an obsessive rumination about European violence and despair into a phantasmagoric excavation of North American pop culture. Quite a feat.
								</p>
								<p>
									Reading Dead Man’s Float, much of which takes place in a series of symbolic swimming pools, is like immersing oneself in a literary bath made up of many of the most prominent voices of the 20th century. Philip Roth, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Salman Rushdie, Anthony Burgess, and Isaac Bashevis Singer are some of the authors who haunt these pages, with nods here and there to the likes of T.S. Eliot, Arthur Koestler, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ultimately, though, it is two somewhat less-canonical writers whose work this novel most resembles: Steven Millhauser’s strange, Citizen Kane-like Martin Dressler and Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. (Though, unfortunately, it’s only the manic and overblown final third of Smith’s otherwise amazing novel I’m referring to.)
								</p>
								<p>
									The plot here is not complicated. Nathan Gelder, a man in his early seventies, has just suffered a massive stroke. He finds himself floating in a lukewarm pool of memories that go in and out of focus, alternating with bedside scenes of doctors and family members of which the patient is only intermittently aware. Nathan is a Dutch immigrant to Canada, a half-Jew whose parents packed him off at the start of the war to a wealthy uncle in Montreal. They perished – she in the camps and he (the Gentile of the two) by suicide.
								</p>
								<p>
									The novel’s memory trail takes us through Nathan’s upbringing, education, marriage (also to a Gentile), fatherhood, successful career as a translator, and first heart attack. More crucially, it takes us on the familiar but haunting voyage of Holocaust survival: the utter abandonment Nathan feels when his family is wiped out, the isolation and resentment he embraces as he grows up in Canada, irrational bursts of aggressiveness, ambivalence about Israel, and an inability to embrace good fortune. Love comes very hard, too. Moreover, because of his mixed parentage, he is fixated on details of ethnic coding even as he tries to escape them. This confused man’s children are named Peter ("the church’s founding father") and Leni (as in what? Riefenstahl?).
								</p>
								<p>
									As he ages, Nathan’s obsessions become more acute, not less. He is determined to avenge his parents’ death and becomes convinced that his appropriate victim is a mega-star rock/rap singer named Leonard Barvis, whose message to the world is one of monstrous egotism: "There ain’t no wisdom/There ain’t no wealth/There ain’t no freedom/Your soul is mine." Barvis’s worldwide acolytes dress themselves in his uniform – white jackets and red jodhpurs – and his quasi-religious rock concerts have a strong whiff of Nuremberg about them. Nathan stalks the singer on a five-city tour that ends, fatally for Barvis, on the roof of a hotel in downtown Toronto. Did Nathan do it? That’s really the only mystery in this novel, which becomes horribly belaboured in its last 100 pages.
								</p>
								<p>
									But before that overheated and ill-advised climax, the reader is taken on a clever and fascinating journey through the second half of the 20th century, Nathan’s life marking its personal milestones in time with history’s beat: "As I was reading an account of Hilary’s conquest of Mt. Everest..." "The night the Berlin Wall took shape..." Eventually he hits the 1980s, when a neverending televised string of 50th anniversaries makes him live his early life over again. In fact, Maes makes a good case that it’s the constant media obsession with these anniversaries that finally drives men like Nathan round the bend. "Fifty years of guff and fury and failure and fantasy and procrastination," Gelder tells us from his memory-pool, sounding a little like Hamlet and a little like Macbeth.
								</p>
								<p>
									If there is a serious theme in the midst of all this pop-culture satire, it is Nathan’s concern with distinctiveness – personal, racial, and political. After his parents’ death in Nazi Europe, it is natural perhaps for him to crave assimilation, which is why he goes a bit berserk when his son "converts" to a seriously Orthodox strain of Judaism. On the other hand, Leonard Barvis represents the complete eradication of personality and difference in the face of an all-powerful and domineering global force. "Can we abide without distinctions?" asks Nathan at the end of the book, by which time his inner voice is incessantly repeating the words, "Nathan Barvis Nathan Barvis Nathan Barvis." A dark ending to a most curious and rewarding novel.
